# What will you learn

Basic feature of this workshop will be to start exploring and modeling data using R along-with hands-on experience. All workshops recording, codes, slides and related things will be provided to all the participants once they will register for the workshop.

## By the end of Data Analysis with R, you'll understand:

-   How to use base R and tidyverse to carry out analysis on your own data
-   The core features of a data analysis workflow
-   Generating summary statistics, visualizing and doing econometrics data

## And you'll be able to use:

-   Basic functions in the tidyverse to process raw data for typical data analysis questions
-   Logical expressions and indexing to ask specific questions of data
-   Functions to conduct common statistical tests
-   Application of conepts on a case study data of Health Insurance Subsidy Program data

## Why this is for you

-   You have your own data sets and you want to analyze it
-   You think R is important but intimidated by R and dont know where to start with
-   You want to do good in data analytics
-   You want to get data insight for your intelligent decision making
-   You want to be at par in academia with the rest of the world

# Uploaded data and required R packages

Understanding datasets requires many hours/days or in some cases weeks.There are many commercially available softwares but open source community based softwares have now dominated and R is one of these. R makes data understanding process as easy as possible through the dplyr package. It is one of the easiest solution for code-based data analysis. We will learn in this training how to do it. I have already uploaded videos for downloading packages and relevant information. [Installing R and RStudio](https://youtu.be/ZNBZevfYgo00),
