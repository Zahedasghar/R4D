I suggest you to do so in the following order:\nInstall R.\nInstall R-Studio.\nCreate a GitHub account. Take some care with the user-name if you want to keep this account throughout your career. You can’t change it afterwards.\nInstall Git.\n\nOpen a shell. On windows, Git comes with its own shell. Open it by searching for “Git Bash”. On Mac, just search for your “Terminal” application. Enter the following commands:\n\n`git config –global user.name ‘Your name’’\n‘git config –global user.email ’Your E-mail linked to GitHub’`\n\n(optional) Sometimes, using a GUI can be convenient for interacting with Git. GitHub Desktop has gotten pretty decent recently. The GitHub Desktop installation wizard also helps you with configuring Git such that you can skip step 1.\n\nI have already uploaded videos for downloading packages and relevant information for those who have difficulty in understanding above mentioned points.\nInstalling R and RStudio,\nR Packages, Library, Errors,\nR Codes Basics"
