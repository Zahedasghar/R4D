This resource is built with the idea that we sometimes just need to see how functions work in action to understand them; just link the materials for each section to see the functions “in-action”. The materials here can be used as an introduction or for reference. The {tidyverse} is an open source project in R lead by Hadley Wickham; the {tidyverse} itself contains several packages designed to work together in a consistent, logical, and human-friendly fashion."
